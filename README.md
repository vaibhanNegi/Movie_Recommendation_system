# Movie Recommendation System ðŸŽ¬

This Movie Recommendation System suggests 5 movies related to a userâ€™s search using API data and data visualization tools. Built with technologies like NumPy, pandas, seaborn, pyplot, and Streamlit, this project allows users to explore movie recommendations interactively.

## Features

- **Interactive Movie Recommendations**: Provides 5 related movies based on user input.
- **API Data Integration**: Fetches real-time movie data from an external API.
- **Data Visualization**: Includes visualizations of popular genres, trends, and ratings distribution using seaborn and pyplot.
- **Streamlit Interface**: User-friendly interface that allows for easy input and instant movie recommendations.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core language used for data manipulation and processing.
- **NumPy**: Used for numerical operations and handling arrays.
- **pandas**: For data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis.
- **seaborn & pyplot**: Data visualization libraries for creating charts and plots.
- **Streamlit**: For building an interactive web-based application.
- **API Integration**: Fetches live movie data for recommendations.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-recommendation-system.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd movie-recommendation-system
   ```
3. **Install the required libraries**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Streamlit app**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
2. **Search for a Movie**: Enter a movie title in the search bar, and the system will provide 5 recommended movies based on the entered movie.
3. **Explore Visualizations**: View visual insights on movie data, such as genre popularity and ratings distribution.

## Future Enhancements

- **Advanced Recommendation Algorithms**: Implement collaborative and content-based filtering for better recommendations.
- **User Profiles**: Enable user-specific recommendations based on past interactions.
- **Enhanced Visualizations**: Add more interactive and detailed visualizations with Plotly.
- **Deployment**: Host the application online for broader accessibility.
